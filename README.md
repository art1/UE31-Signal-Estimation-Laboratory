# UE31-Signal-Estimation-Laboratory

The aim of this laboratory is to implement and compare various approaches for the estimation of parameters from data. In practice, we want to estimate the parameters of a simple model for the flux of a galaxy from a noisy image of a galaxy.

The studied approaches for estimation are least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian estimation in the maximum a posteriori and posterior mean sense. For the optimization we will use the fminsearch Matlab function while for computing the posterior mean estimator we will implement a stochastic sampling method, more precisely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
