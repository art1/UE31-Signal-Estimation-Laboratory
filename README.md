# UE31 - Signal Processing LabWork Reports

The aim of the Signal Processing LabWork was to familiarise and apply techniques studied in the module "UE31 Signal Processing" at Universit√© Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier for the course M2 Technique Spatial et Instrumentation within the SpaceMaster program.
The appropriate MATLAB code and LaTeX source can be found in branch [labreport-1](https://github.com/art1/UE31-Signal-Estimation-Report/tree/labreport-1) respectively [labreport-2](https://github.com/art1/UE31-Signal-Estimation-Report/tree/labreport-2).

## Signal Estimation

The aim of this laboratory is to implement and compare various approaches for the estimation of parameters from data. In practice, we want to estimate the parameters of a simple model for the flux of a galaxy from a noisy image of a galaxy.

The studied approaches for estimation are least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian estimation in the maximum a posteriori and posterior mean sense. For the optimization we will use the fminsearch Matlab function while for computing the posterior mean estimator we will implement a stochastic sampling method, more precisely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

## Spectral Analysis and Sparse Representation
In this laboratory work irregulary sampled data was analysed using the Fourier Transform. Also, different greedy algorithms and a *convex relation* approach are used to evaluate the sparse representation of signals.
